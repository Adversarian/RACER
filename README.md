# RACER

Unofficial Python implementation of the RACER classification algorithm described by [Basiri et. al, 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-017-3117-2).
RACER is designed specifically for discrete datasets and therefore uses the entropy-based MDLP discretization algorithm by [Fayyad and Irani, 1993](http://web.donga.ac.kr/kjunwoo/files/Multi%20interval%20discretization%20of%20continuous%20valued%20attributes%20for%20classification%20learning.pdf) for binary tasks and an [optimal binning strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08025) for the multiclass case. The code is also heavily documented for ease of use.

Please consider citing this work if you use it in an academic setting.

## Installation
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyracer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyracer)
```bash
$ pip install pyracer
```

## Usage
RACER is designed to be consistent with Scikit-learn estimator API which makes it very easy to use.


The following example demonstrates the use of RACER on the Zoo dataset. Take a look at [examples](https://github.com/Adversarian/RACER/tree/main/examples) for more use cases.
### Data Obtention and Cleaning
```python
from RACER import RACER, RACERPreprocessor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

# dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/zoo/
df = pd.read_csv(
    "datasets/zoo.data",
    names=[
        "animal_name",
        "hair",
        "feathers",
        "eggs",
        "milk",
        "airborne",
        "aquatic",
        "predator",
        "toothed",
        "backbone",
        "breathes",
        "venomous",
        "fins",
        "legs",
        "tail",
        "domestic",
        "catsize",
        "type",
    ],
)

X = df.drop(columns=['animal_name', 'type']).astype('category')
Y = df[['type']].astype('category')
```

### RACER Preprocessing Step
RACER requires a preprocessing step to be performed on the data **prior to** splitting into test and train portions. This step discretizes continous features and then converts each feature into a [dummy encoded](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/98172/what-is-the-difference-between-one-hot-and-dummy-encoding) variable. Note that since different discretization methods are used for multiclass and binary classification tasks you need to either specify the task using the `target` keyword argument or leave it to default to `"auto"` which attempts to infer your task when you call `fit_transform(X,y)` from the number of unique values in `y`.
```python
X, Y = RACERPreprocessor(target="multiclass").fit_transform(X, Y)

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X,Y, random_state=1, test_size=0.3)
```

### Fitting RACER on the Dataset
RACER provides a `benchmark` keyword argument that can be used to time the `fit` method. Moreover, the hyperparameter `alpha` can be set using its respective keyword argument. (Note that `beta` is uniquely determined as `1.0 - alpha` and is therefore not exposed through a keyword argument)
```python
racer = RACER(alpha=0.95, benchmark=True)
racer.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```

Now you may access the public methods available within the `racer` object such as `score` and `display_rules`. For example:
```python
>>> racer.score(X_test, Y_test)
0.8709677419354839

>>> racer.display_rules()
Algorithm Parameters:
	- Alpha: 0.95
	- Time to fit: 0.008133015999987947s

Final Rules (8 total): (if --> then (label) | fitness)
	[111011011111111101011011111000111111] --> [1000000] (0) | 0.9685714285714285

```
## To Do
- ~Add another example notebook featuring Scikit-learn's built-in datasets.~
- Unify discretization algorithms for all tasks.
- Better docs!
